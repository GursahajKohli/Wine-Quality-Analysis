# Wine Quality Analysis

How is wine quality decided? The region, the grape type, or the production year? Can we predict it only from the physicochemical characteristics?
Let us decide it using Machine Learning.

**Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):**


1 - fixed acidity

2 - volatile acidity

3 - citric acid

4 - residual sugar

5 - chlorides

6 - free sulfur dioxide

7 - total sulfur dioxide

8 - density

9 - pH

10 - sulphates

11 - alcohol

**Output variable (based on sensory data):**

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

**Results**

We got an accuracy of **80.15%** using Random Forest Classifier.
